### Controls
WASD - to pan the camera in volume renderer
Home - resets camera
Double Click - place point light at cursor position

### 3D View
Our 3D view uses Raymarching to display a volumetric rendering of the volume.

Our Transfer function affects how the model is displayed.

We have 3 sliders at the top right to "slice" the volume

### CrossSection View
The cross section view has two sliders, one to change the axis, and one to change the depth

### Transfer Function


### Histogram
Our histogram shows where the values of the model are, lined up with the transfer function

## Build instructions
The project should work out of the box using Qt 6.2.2 on windows
